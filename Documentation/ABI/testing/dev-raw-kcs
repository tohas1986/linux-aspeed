Description:	``/dev/raw-kcs*`` exposes to userspace the data and
		status registers of Keyboard-Controller-Style (KCS) IPMI
		interfaces via read() and write() syscalls. Direct
		exposure of the data and status registers enables
		inefficient but arbitrary protocols to be implemented
		over the device. A typical approach is to use KCS
		devices for out-of-band signalling for bulk data
		transfers over other interfaces between a Baseboard
		Management Controller and its host.
